  <div class="section" id="todo">
<h2>Todo</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Should probably add my technical portfolio to the main page,
maybe under the heading 'Analysis and Code'. If so, maybe I will
combined 'Essays' and 'Poems' into a single category 'Writing.'
If the items listed on the front page become too long, maybe I
would need to add a link to 'More Writing' at the bottom of
'Writing,' and a similiar overflow link in other sections.
The website would be a portfolio for both my writing and other
work.</li>
<li>Move poems listed in 'poems published elsewhere' to the main list?</li>
<li>Move hyperlink in 'works published elsewhere' to the title, away from the publication?</li>
<li>In index page, use <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;section&gt;&gt;</tt> as the sectioning element.
Currently, I don't think I have one.</li>
<li>Remove the <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;hr&gt;</tt>: my use of it is not semantic, does not
follow the HTML5 spec.</li>
<li>Do I really need a sitemap? Some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/wiki/Tips-n-Tricks">tips</a> to implement this.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="won-t-do">
<h3>Won't Do</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In <tt class="docutils literal">base.html</tt> template, add metadata like author to head?</li>
<li>In <tt class="docutils literal">about.html</tt> page, use <tt class="docutils literal">address</tt> element,
maybe in the vCard (?) microformat.</li>
<li>Add a favicon?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="done">
<h3>Done</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How to indicate citation of other works, like book in footnote? Or Twilight movie in one essay?
There exists an HTML tag <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;cite&gt;</tt> which is maybe the one to use.
This can maybe be implemented using RST's <tt class="docutils literal">:role:cite</tt>.
Browsers will automatically put the text enclosed in italics.
I think it can also be done with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:title:`text`</span></tt> or simply <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:t:`text`</span></tt></li>
<li>Maybe created a single post which links to the 12 lyric essays;
or could put in a single big page and add a TOC at the top with
<tt class="docutils literal">.. contents:: My Table of Contents</tt>.</li>
<li>Init a git repo in the 'output' folder and push to Github pages
repo for hosting.</li>
<li>Add a <em>blogroll</em>: &quot;A blogroll is a list of links on a blog, usually on the
sidebar for easy access, that the blog writer likes and wants to share.&quot;</li>
<li>Use ALA state abbreviations in Readings? What is NY?</li>
<li>Maybe add a symbol on the title banner by <em>HEAP</em>, e.g. a triangle (like a pile of
sand in an hourglass). This would be like Winston's &quot;Five-Star&quot; method, i.e.
adding a <em>symbol</em>.</li>
<li>Get HTML structure to match previous blog.</li>
<li>On second thought, maybe should strip the HTML down: remove all unnecessary
classes and ids. Focus on the <em>structure</em>, guiding by the HTML specification.
Try to make the tree structure clear and correct.
Don't worry about the presentation at all for now. Just use the Tufte CSS unaltered.</li>
<li>How to do em-dashes in rST? Can't. Have to use <tt class="docutils literal">^V</tt> thing in vim.</li>
<li>Need to go back through essays and clean up the markup</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="git">
<h2>Git</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I have created a local branch called <tt class="docutils literal">pelican</tt> of the git repo.</li>
<li>When I push to the master branch, I need to do it correctly.
This <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4752387/pushing-a-local-branch-up-to-github">Stackoverflow question</a> has some info that might
be helpful.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-notes">
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Maybe redesign the view, e.g. maybe a white background. <a class="reference external" href="https://hamberg.no/erlend/">This site</a> has nice text.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> provides CSS guidance/stylesheets based on typography theory.
I may be able to rely on this heavily.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-thoughts">
<h2>Other Thoughts</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I think we want a single directory for all non-personal notes, both drafts and final. The draft status can be set with a meta tag, which Pelican can use to decide to include or not.</li>
<li>We will keep a last modified date for each document.</li>
<li>I think in Pelican you can have a &quot;drafts&quot; category which can be set to not be published.</li>
</ul>
