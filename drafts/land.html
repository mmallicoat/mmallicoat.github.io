<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Sometime in 2018, I came across the website of game designer Avery Alder.
I noticed that she described where she lived as &quot;in the Slocan Valley, in
Sinixt and Ktunaxa Territory,&quot; and not as &quot;British Columbia, Canada.&quot;</p>
<p>She elaborates on her motivations in a series of <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/lackingceremony/status/1041008025413181440">Tweets</a> (on 15
September 2018):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I frequently get cited as a 'Canadian game designer', and for the record I
am always bothered by that. I'm a designer on unceded Sinixt territory, and
previous to moving I was a designer on unceded Squamish, Musqueam, and
Tsleil-Waututh territory'</p>
<p>as a settler on unceded land, I do not want my work attributed to Canada,
nor do I want to be involved in any assertion of its primacy over this land.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was my first introduction to the concept of &quot;unceded territory.&quot; Doing
some searches on the Web for this term introduced me to the practice of &quot;land
acknowldgements.&quot; These are both connected to project of decolonization, which
I now realize I know woefully little about.</p>
<p>As I learn more about this complex relationship between the land and people, I
want to collect some of the resources and references I find and share them on
this page.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Land Acknowledgement</a></h2>
<p><em>Land acknowledgements</em> (as they are sometimes called) are public statements
acknowledging the original habitants of the physical territory that we now
occupy. (They acknowledge that the original people <em>existed</em> and that we are
now here as <em>guests</em>. It acknowledges the history of colonialism and
displacement.)</p>
<p>They are usually made at public events—like lectures, arts performances, sports
matches—and by public institutions that occupy space such as schools and
universities.</p>
<p>When I first learned of the concept, it seemed to be a practice that had only
gained a foothold in Canada [and maybe other former British colonies like New
Zealand?], but not in my native United States.  But now that I am familiar, I
have found a couple in the wild here in the States.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Chicago Cultural Center</a></h3>
<p>The Settler Colonial City Project <a class="footnote-reference" href="#sccp" id="id2">[2]</a>, in partnership with the American
Indian Center of Chicago (AIC) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#aic" id="id3">[3]</a>, contributed to the 2019 Chicago
Architecture Biennial, held at the Chicago Cultural Center. They were
commissioned to attempt the insurmountable task of &quot;decolonizing the Chicago
Cultural Center.&quot; As part of this project the AIC drafted a land
acknowledgement. The preface to the acknowledge provides some context for this
type of statement: <a class="footnote-reference" href="#decolonizing" id="id4">[4]</a></p>
<blockquote>
In recent years it has become a trend to acknowledge the traditional
homelands of the Indigenous peoples of a particular area through a land
acknowledgement.  This type of activity is designed to bring more awareness and
understanding of the history of Indigenous peopls and their territories. But a
land acknowledgement should also be more than that; it should be a call to
rethink one's own relationship with the environment and the histories of all
peoples. [...]</blockquote>
<p>The acknowledgement itself, desplayed at the entrance of the Chicago Cultural
Center, read:</p>
<blockquote>
Chicago is part of the traditional homelands of the Council of the Three
Fires: the Odawa, Ojibwe, and the Potawatomi nations. Many other tribes—such as
the Miami, Ho-Chunk, Sac, and Fox—also called this area home. Located at the
intersection of several great waterways, the land naturally became a site of
travel and healing for many tribes. Today, Chicago is still a place that calls
people from diverse backgrounds to live and gather. American Indians continue
to live in the region, and Chicago is home to the country's third-largest urban
American Indian community, which still practices its heritage and traditions,
including care for the land and waterways. Despite the numerous changes the
city has experienced, its American Indian and architecture communities both see
the importance of the land and of this place, which has always been hospitable
to many difference backgrounds and perspectives.</blockquote>

<p>During the 2019 season of the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#krannert" id="id5">[5]</a>, the programs handed out at performances included a land
acknowledgement. The text from one program read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The University of Illinois System carries out its mission in its namesake
state, which includes the traditional territory of the Peoria, Kaskaskia,
Piankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi,
Ojibwe, Menominee, Ho-Chunk, and Chickasaw Nations. These lands continue to
carry stories of these Nationas and their struggles for survival and identity.</p>
<p>As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois has a particular
responsibility to acknowledge the peoplese of these lands, as well as the
histories of dispossession that have allowed for the growth of this institution
for the past 150 years. We are also obligrated to reflect on and actively
address these histories and the role that this university has played in shaping
them. This acknowledgement and the centering of Native peoples is a start ass
we move forward for the next 150 years.</p>
<p>Krannert Center affirms the commitment by the university to move beyond these
statements, toward building deeper relationships and taking actions that uphold
and preserve Indigenous rights and cultural equity.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Unceded Territory</a></h2>
<p>In North America, represenatives of colonial powers entered into numerous
treaties with native peoples to acquire land in exchange for [annuities, goods,
and land elsewhere]. In this way, huge portions of North America, by way of
convoluted &quot;chains of title,&quot; came to be claimed by what are now Canada and the
United States. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#na" id="id6">[7]</a> For much of the land in these two states, the government can
point to a particular legal document which enacted the transfer in ownership.
But for large expanses of the land, Canada and the US do not possess even the
most tenuous legal claim. This land is considered &quot;unceded.&quot;</p>
<p>In the United States, the most obvious tract of unceded territory is the land
around the original 13 British colonies on the Eastern seaboard.</p>
<!-- Add map of unceded territory in the US -->
<p>In Canada, much of British Columbia and [...] are unceded territory.</p>
<!-- Add map of unceded territory in Canada -->
<!-- Rewrite rest of this section? -->
<p>In Chicago (where I live as of 2019) I believe that the land underneath the
city center was ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Greenville, signed
on August 3, 1795. The counterparty was the Western Confederacy, a confederacy
of (Iriqouis people and French frontiersmen?) which lasted from (xxxx-xxxx).
This treaty ceded six square miles underneath the site of (what was once Fort
Dearborn?).</p>
<p>Since the shoreline with Lake Michigan has been pushed back since this 1795,
filled in with debris from the Great Chicago Fire of XXXX and by other efforts
(?), much of the coastal land in this area is not part of any treaty. Here is a
digram from <em>Mapping Chicagou/Chicago</em> (a companion book to <em>Decolonizing the
Chicago Cultural Center</em>) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#mapping" id="id7">[6]</a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Chicago shoreline with Lake Michigan over time" src="./media/shoreline-unceded-land.png" />
</div>
<p>Because this land was never covered by any treaty, the Settler Colonial City
Project characterizes this as unceded. Below is a photo of an installation
piece at the Chicago Cultural Center (also taken from <em>Mapping
Chicagou/Chicago</em>). These windows face east over Michigan Ave, which
originally ran along the lake shore.</p>

<p>Accompanying Claudio Saunt's book <em>West of the Revolution</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#wotr" id="id8">[8]</a>, an
interactive map of land cessions to the United States was produced, hosted
online <a class="reference external" href="http://invasionofamerica.ehistory.org/">here</a>. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ioa" id="id9">[9]</a> The map shows
the parcel of land covered in each of the cessions along with links to text of
the treaties. It also shows the boundaries of Native territory today.</p>
<p>The information on the cessions comes from two books. First of which is the the
<em>Eighteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution</em>, produced 1896–97. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ar" id="id10">[10]</a> The second part of
the book contains a section &quot;Indian Land Cessions in the United States&quot;
compiled by Charles C. Royce in 1902. There are extensive tables containing
dates, signatories, and a brief description of the treaties between between the
United States and Native nations and confederations. It is availaible to read
on <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/annualreportofbu218smit">Archive.org</a>.</p>
<p>The second book is <em>Indian Affairs: Laws And Treaties</em>, compiled in 1902 by
Charles J. Kappler, Clerk to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ia" id="id11">[11]</a>
This contains the full text of the treaties. It is available to read at
<a class="reference external" href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008319763">HathiTrust.org</a>.</p>
<p>I also found a map of <a class="reference external" href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/unnumbered/70114965/plate-1.pdf">&quot;Indian land areas judicially established&quot;</a> comissioned by the
<a class="reference external" href="IndianClaimsCommission">Indian Claims Commission</a>. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ilje" id="id12">[12]</a> I believe it
was produced at the direction of the Indian Claims Commission before its
closing in 1978. The map contains a note that says:</p>
<blockquote>
This map portrays the results of cases before the U.S. Indian Claims Commission
or U.S. Court of Claims in which an American Indian tribe proved its original
tribal occupancy of a tract within the continental United States.</blockquote>
