  <p>How does a writer find publications to submit their work to? The answer doesn't
seem to be clear cut. I am not well informed, but here are some of my notes on
how to go about the search. (This information is heavily biased to the American
literary market, but maybe you can find analogues to these sources in your own
country.)</p>
<div class="section" id="directories-and-trade-magazines">
<h2>Directories and Trade Magazines</h2>
<p>In the old days, from what I gather, writers would refer to directories like
<em>Writer's Market</em> (WM) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#wm" id="id1">[2]</a> and <em>Literary Market Place</em> (LMP). These books
contain lists of magazines, publishers, and literary agents, as well as
information as to the kind of work they're interested in. In <em>On Writing</em>,
Stephen King calls <em>Writer's Market</em> &quot;the most valuable of tools for the writer
new to the marketplace.&quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ow" id="id2">[1]</a> I think this sort of information could also be
found in trade magazines like <em>Writer's Digest</em>, <em>Poets &amp; Writers</em>, and
<em>Publishers Weekly</em>.</p>
<p>These directories are still published every year to keep them up to date. Many
libraries have copies of WM and LMP in their reference section. You may be able
to find copies of writing/publishing trade magazines at the library as well.</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="ow" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id2">[1]</a></td><td>King, Stephen. <em>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</em>. Scribner, 2000, ch. 4.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="wm" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[2]</a></td><td><em>Writer's Market</em> is published by Writer's Digest Books. They have an
directories tailored to particular forms, e.g., <em>Poet's Market</em> and
<em>Novel and Short Story Writer's Market</em>. They publish <em>Guide to Literary Agents</em>.
They happen to also publish the periodical <em>Writer's Digest</em> mentioned above.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div class="section" id="online-resources">
<h2>Online Resources</h2>
<p>Beyond these print directories, there are some online resources that can be
useful.</p>
<p><em>Poets &amp; Writers</em> maintains a list of literary magazines on their <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pw.org/literary_magazines">website</a> with thumbnail descriptions and
genre tags.</p>
<p>The Council of Literary Magazines and Presses (CMLP) compiles a directory of
independent literary publishers. While it used to be published in print, it is
now available <a class="reference external" href="https://www.clmp.org/readers/directory/">online</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://whopayswriters.com">Who Pays Writers</a> is a crowd-sourced database of
rates paid by magazines for work.</p>
<p>I think the submission manager <a class="reference external" href="https://www.submittable.com/">Submittable</a>
has a &quot;Discover&quot; feature on their website which shows open calls for
submissions.</p>
<p>A few times a year, <em>Entropy</em> publishes links to magazines with <a class="reference external" href="https://entropymag.org/category/where-to-submit/">calls for
submissions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="follow-the-breadcrumbs">
<h2>Follow the Breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>You can also find magazines by following your nose instead of these more
systematic methods.</p>
<p>If there is an author you like, you can try to find the names of presses and
periodicals who have published their work. If it seems like a good fit, you
could submit to those, too. This sort of bibliographic information could be
found in the back of one of their books or embedded in biographical blurbs on
their website or in a magazine where their work appeared.</p>
<p>Literary magazines usually publish short biographies of the authors appearing
in the issue. It seems to be standard practice for writers to list the names of
other magazines they've been published in and/or the publishers of their books.
By reading these, you can find new magazines to check out. Those magazines will
have the bios of more authors and the names of more magazines. By spidering
along (not unlike a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">web crawler</a>), you can discover lots of
magazines. If you find one you like, you can try submitting your work to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendix-how-to-submit">
<h2>Appendix: How to Submit</h2>
<p>Here is a super-short guide on how to submit work to a book publisher or
magazine.</p>
<p>If you found the press or magazine in one of those print directories, there are
probably instructions provided about how to submit.</p>
<p>If you find them online, go to their website. Look around for a link to an
&quot;About&quot; or &quot;Submissions&quot; page. Sometimes these links are buried down at the
bottom of the page. There, you can usually find submission guidelines or
information on who to ask about submitting work.</p>
<p>Whatever the instructions say—how to send your work, who to send it to, file
formats, length restrictions, etc.—follow them as closely as you can. If you
know the name of the editor, address them by name in your cover letter. (I
won't get into cover letters... I don't know how to write these properly.)</p>
<p>After you've sent your work out, wait patiently. Forget about it. If your work
is accepted, congratulations! If you receive a boilerplate rejection notice,
don't send any reply. Don't dwell on the rejection, just move on to your next
submission. If you receive a personalized rejection, congratulations! Send a
thank-you note.</p>
